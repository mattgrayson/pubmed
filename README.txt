pubmed.py, v. 0.3.3

Simple interface for searching and retrieving articles from PubMed via the 
Entrez Programming Utilities <http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>. It does not 
provide access to all of the Entrez utilities and only parses a subset of the 
elements included in PubmedArticle. There's probably a better way to do this ...
